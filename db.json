[Scammed out of $130K via fake Google call, spoofed Google email and auth sync](https://bewildered.substack.com/p/i-was-scammed-out-of-130000-and-google)\n\n    ![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OIwF!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7948a118-68b8-4918-9469-a09f546ca912_1024x1024.png)\n\n    The author detailed account of a $130,000 cryptocurrency theft facilitated by a sophisticated Google impersonation scam and critical vulnerabilities in Google's authentication systems.\n\n    > **Insights from People's discussions:**\n\n    - **Irreversible Crypto Theft Risk:**  The fundamental unreliability and high risk of permanent loss associated with crypto assets compared to traditional banking.\n\n    - **2FA Vulnerabilities and Password Reuse:**  The significant security risks posed by password reuse, syncing 2FA codes to cloud services (especially Google), and the potential for compromised accounts (like email) to lead to broader account takeovers, citing the Coinbase incident.\n\n    - **Avoid unknown calls for scams:**  Unsolicited calls promising unusual benefits are often scams, and to verify legitimacy, one should insist on a verifiable contact method (like a specific phone number or email address) rather than relying solely on caller ID which can be spoofed.\n\n    - **2FA security practices**: Google Authenticator's default cloud sync feature poses a security risk if compromised, users should disable it and use backup codes, opt for third-party authenticators like Authy or Bitwarden with encryption, avoid tying 2FA and password management together, and maintain offline backups for enhanced security.\n\n    - **A few reminders bear repeating:**\n\n      - no support group from a big company is going to call you. Ever.\n      - never give out codes sent to use via sms or push notifications to someone requesting them via phone or email. Never. The messages often even say that!\n      - Don’t put all your private info behind one password, so don’t use Google Authenticator backed by your Google Account as your password manager.

Mixed&#x2F;Negative leaning)</em></li>\n<li><strong>Frustration with Hacker News Moderation&#x2F;Usability:</strong>  This viewpoint focuses on user experiences with Hacker News, specifically complaints about comments appearing dead or unverified, platform usability issues, and a perceived decline in the site’s utility or community standards.  <em>(Sentiment: Negative)</em></li>\n<li><strong>Mobile Security, Routing, and Network Performance:</strong>  This viewpoint discusses practical experiences and technical details regarding mobile roaming (e.g., unexpected routing via Hong Kong), carrier restrictions (like Chinese carriers blocking foreign eSIM activation), the quality and security of eSIM providers, and the effectiveness of various solutions (VPNs, DoH, Tor) for addressing network performance (latency) and privacy, acknowledging both theoretical limitations and practical challenges.  <em>(Sentiment:
